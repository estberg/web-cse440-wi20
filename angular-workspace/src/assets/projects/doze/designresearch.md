### The Problem: Prioritizing Sleep
Sleep is a critical part of growth and development. It is surprising, then, that sleep is so often neglected by
college students. As the lives of students become more crowded and complex, where does sleep fit in? Between
studies, work, extracurricular activities, and social events, many students fail to find the time to do everything
and end up sacrificing sleep as a result. Our group wants to examine sleeping habits of adolescents, focusing on
this central question:

**How do we facilitate proper sleeping habits for those that can sleep earlier but won't?**

Our solution, a smart pillow, uses tracking to empower users and inform them on ways to improve their sleeping habits.
In our design process, we determined that our solution needed to inform users on the effects of a healthy sleep
schedule and furthermore needed to encourage healthier sleep. A smart pillow allows us to gather the data necessary
and a companion app gave us the ability to educate users on sleeping habits more effectively. Here, we will describe
the evolution of our design and how we were able to reach a smart pillow.

### Design Research Goals:
To learn about sleeping habits of our target demographic, we chose three main research methods.

* A questionnaire to gauge general trends
* A diary study to gain in depth insights on sleeping habits of individual students
* An expert interview to learn about the science of sleep and how it affects our demographic

#### Questionnaire
Our questionnaire was designed specifically with the intention of gaining large scale insights into the sleeping habits
of our target demographic: college-aged adolescents. In order to accomplish this, we crafted questions to be simple
and unintrusive. The survey itself was anonymous and short, allowing us to more effectively gather responses from
a wide range of people. The survey would inform us on the needs of the general population we were dealing with and
how to best tackle our problem. Questions covered demographic information, sleep routine, fatigue, and sleep disorders.
The variety in questions would give us a broad data set that we could draw key insights from.

#### Diary Study
We chose to do a diary study to complement the questionnaire. The questionnaire enabled us to find a large quantity
of research participants. However, we felt the need to go more in depth with our research to find out what specific
parts of a sleep routine were important to study. We attempted to study this by doing a diary study. Our main goal
throughout the process was to identify what parts of a person's life most affected sleep. We asked participants to
fill out a detailed journal for approximately 4 days, including information about daily routine, bedtime rituals,
sleep quality, and mood or fatigue. The diaries went much farther in depth to help us find out more about the factors
affecting a person's sleep.

#### Expert Interview
For our expert interview, we reached out to several people regarding an interview.
Due to limited time availability of such experts, we were able to successfully arrange one interview.
This expert sleep researcher's work and experience perfectly fit our project's scope.
We met with her after the majority of our research had concluded (due to availability constraints).
She was a fantastic resource and we felt compelled to talk to her.
The focus of our questions was mainly sleep and its relationship with adolescent growth and development.

### Design Research Results:

#### Questionnaire
The questionnaire we distributed received 48 responses. The participants came from a variety of majors and had class
standings ranging from freshmen to PhD students. We gained many insights from the surveys. 75% of students reported
sleeping after 12am on weekdays, 85% of people reported sleeping after 12am on weekends, and most importantly, **69%**
of participants revealed that they had attempted to change their sleeping habits but failed. We saw there was a clear
need for tracking to aide one's ability to sleep and to encourage our population to prioritize sleep more than they
currently are. More specifically, we learned that **effects of sleep deprivation varied greatly within the population of college students**.
This meant that our design would need to be universal, learning about the user then adjusting to the individual.
Additionally, we found that **effective sleep routines remained consistent**. By this we mean that consistency of
bedtime in addition to duration of sleep improved mood and fatigue by a lot.

#### Diary Study
In our diary study, we had six participants journal for about four days. Reading through the information given to us
gave us insight into how to design our solution. The first insight we gained from reading through our journals was how
**events throughout the entire day affected sleep quality**. We saw that many participants indicated lower quality of sleep
on days that were negative or sad. The activities or schedule of a person can greatly influence their sleep, even if said
activites took place in the middle of the day. The relationship also worked in the other direction as we had observed many people
experiencing worse attittude on days where they had gotten minimal sleep the night before. The next insight we found
was the **importance of sleep environment**. Each person's environment was different and we found that
**many factors contributing to sleep deprivation or poor sleep quality were controllable**. Things that are known to have a huge effect
on sleep that we found affected participants in our diary study were light and noise, specifically blue light.
Participants had noted that blue light from devices often played a huge role in their sleep loss.

#### Expert Interview
Our interview with the expert sleep researcher yielded a plethora of information to consider in our design. We prepared a series of
questions beforehand and learned a lot about her work and research. Because this was after our checkpoint was due,
we had time to discuss our findings from the questionnaire and diary study. Our conversation yielded a
few key insights. She discussed with us
the **importance of data** and how it could be used to improve people's sleep and by consequence the rest of their lives.
We additionally discussed details of sleep and how it affects college students in particular. An extremely interesting part
of the interview revolved around **circadian rhythm and how it varies within our population**. It further changed our
thinking about sleep habits. We knew the solution we came up with would need to be universal and able to accommodate
a variety of students' needs. Overall the interview was fun and informative. We drew from the interview when designing
the gamification of our app and when thinking about how to best meet the needs of the diverse population.

### Identified Tasks
We identify the following six tasks to be important to our design:

* Creating social progress trackers shared between users as a social experience to encourage better sleep routines
and accountability

    This idea originated as a sleep competition, but over the course of our research, we redefined it to be a social
    progress tracker. The incentive to sleep is not very strong for many people, so we want to provide some kind of
    progress tracker that not only displays one's data for their own growth, but also shares it to encourage others
    to follow their good example. Our goal with this task is not only to share good practices, but also to challenge
    existing notions of sleep as a low priority. We want a way to encourage people to sleep more and to move away from
    a culture that tolerates or even celebrates prioritizing other responsibilities over sleep and personal well-being.

* Displaying clear and straightforward data regarding their sleep routine and physical health for people

    Our solution needs to be personal, helping users based on their specific needs. Because of this, a major part of
    our approach is centered on showing people their own data so they can make decisions about how to best improve their
    sleep. Our design needed to help the user figure out what works best for them instead of basing decisions off of
    generalized data. Part of that is communicating sleep data in a way that's simple and concise.

* Cultivating a relaxed mindset and environment for better sleep

    Our research showed that the environment a person sleeps in has a major effect on their sleep patterns. Things
    such as light, noise, and temperature should be taken into account by our design. More generally, our design
    needed to inform the user on what external factors were in their control that could be affecting their sleep.

* Encouraging people to reconsider how they prioritize sleep

    One of the main focuses of our project from the start was encouraging people to reprioritize sleep. For students
    with many major responsibilities, sleep is often a low priority. When faced with high pressure from deadlines,
    people will often stay up late to finish something. Our design should discourage this by encouraging users to
    reexamine their priorities and plan ahead to prevent situations occurring where they are forced to stay up late.
    Sleep and self-care should be encouraged and prioritized above school, work, or other responsibilities.

* Helping people adapt a balanced daily schedule to avoid conflicting with their sleep routine/circadian rhythm

    As we discovered from our interview with an expert sleep researcher, sleep can differ greatly among individuals and the most
    challenging group to cater to would be those whose sleep schedules didn't align with their day-to-day responsibilities.
    Some people experience the most focus and productivity at night, for instance, and consequently struggle to find a
    sleep schedule that accommodates their work or school. One of our tasks is to help people like this by finding
    a way to eliminate or at least mitigate the difficulties associated with their sleep routine.

* Informing people how sleep can help accomplish their goals

    Our final goal is to teach people how sleep can help them accomplish their goals. It isn't uncommon for people to
    ignore sleep's effects on their lives. People can sometimes see sleep as a natural part of their routine and don't
    give any further consideration to its improvement. People don't think about how getting more sleep can help one's
    entire life and instead treat it as wasted time. In reality, sleep is almost like an investment. The time spent
    sleeping isn't wasted. In fact, sleep deprivation is linked to several health conditions and poorer performance in
    school or work. We want our solution to inform people of this and change the attitude towards sleep to be more
    positive, making it a necessity instead of a chore.

### Proposed Designs

#### Smart Ring/Bracelet
Our first design was a smart ring or bracelet. The idea was to have a wearable device that would track vital information
during sleep. The device could be used as an alarm and could be used without a phone or computer. The smart ring would
have a companion app that focused primarily on communicating data to the user, but would be out of the way to discourage
phone use before bed.

#### Alarm Clock
Our second design was an alarm clock. An alarm clock was a natural choice of form since it is already a part of many people's
routines. It would be a convenient and subtle way to make it easy for people to gather data. Unlike our other approaches, an
alarm clock would not require a companion app. Instead it could track data and provide insights to the user itself without
having to connect to a device or the internet. The form factor allowed for a wide array of sensors for the environment a
person sleeps in, but couldn't truly track information about the user themselves without manual input. In addition, the approach
using a device that worked independently of a computer or internet allowed for greater privacy and security of data.

#### Smart Pillow
Our final design was a smart pillow. This design contrasted with our other approaches because it was already a part of most
people's sleep, and we thought if we could get the cost low enough, it would be an easier sell because of that. The pillow
is primarily used to track data. Using flexible sensors and memory foam we wanted to gather data on factors relating to sleep.
A companion app could be used to visualize and share this data. Additionally, the pillow could house a speaker, a small motor,
or even a heater to get a desired sleeping environment.

### Selected Design and Storyboards
Our selected design is the smart pillow. We chose the smart pillow because this design would allow for accurate and
thorough data collection while still remaining convenient for our users. It would therefore be the best way to engage
our target audience. If we are able to maintain a low cost relative to normal pillows, we believe this design will be
the best and easiest to get college students to adopt.

#### Storyboard 1:
Our first scenario involves the social progress tracker. It is used as an extrinsic motivation for a healthy sleep
routine. A person can see other people's progress and has a character that models their own health. Having such
data motivates our user to finish his work and sleep earlier.

#### Storyboard 2:
Our second scenario describes Richard, who struggles to sleep due to his obsession with his phone. It demonstrates
how a smart pillow can help a user gather data and help them go to sleep without the necessity of a phone.
