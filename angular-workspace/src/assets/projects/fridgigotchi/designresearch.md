### The Problem
In the United States, food waste is as prevalent as it is ecologically and economically damaging. The USDA estimates that between 30 and 40 percent of the food supply in America is wasted, equivalent to 133 billion pounds and $161 billion worth of food annually. That is 133 billion pounds of food that could have been used to feed the hungry and $161 billion in unnecessary spending for consumers. Additionally, methane released from wasted food represents 6.7% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and that isn’t even counting the emissions created from producing, transporting, and storing wasted food. Taken altogether, food waste is clearly a major issue in both the U.S. and internationally, and measures to reduce food waste would have benefits both ecologically and economically.

### Our Solution
To combat food waste we present Fridgigotchi, a refrigerator attachment that tracks food and helps people use their food before it spoils, all with a fun and cute Tamagotchi-like design. Fridgigotchi works by scanning either barcodes or receipts of recently purchased food and keeping track of estimated expiration dates. A screen would then display how close to spoiling each item is with “health bars” that lower as the food approaches spoilage. Fridgigotchi also recommends recipes based on the scanned food, aiming to get the food used well before it ends up in a landfill. As foods approach spoilage, Fridgigotchi starts to look sadder like an uncared for Tamagotchi, only looking happy again when the food has been used. We hope that this design inspires people to reduce food waste by gently encouraging them to use their perishables and warning them about spoilage well before it occurs.

### Design Research Plans and Goals

Our focus with this project is to help people eat more sustainably, whatever form that might take. That could mean guiding people to more sustainably produced products in grocery stores, helping restaurant owners find ingredients from nearby farms or any other project that would help people help the planet with their food choices.To narrow down our project scope, we intend to interview an expert on sustainable eating to learn where we could have the most impact. Such an expert can likely be found within the UW sustainability network, and can be contacted through the department or their university email. We also want to see if we can assist restaurants in becoming more sustainable, so we plan to interview an owner of a restaurant that prides itself on sustainability to see how they what their approach is, and what improvements could be made. Broadfork, Cafe Flora, and Portage Bay are just a few of the local restaurants with good sustainability reputations that we could contact for interviews. Lastly, we suspect that the way to reach the most people would be through the grocery store, so we also intend to observe how a typical grocery store shopper decides what food to buy through contextual inquiry.
Through the Design Research, our goal is to explore potential problems in food waste, sustainable eating and understand how we could drive people toward sustainable eating in the participants’ perspective.  We try to understand the expert’s, restaurant owner’s and grocery shopper’s sustainable eating habits and experience.

#### Design Research Methods
Since our goal focuses on eliciting information, exploring potential problems and narrowing down our scope, we choose interview as the primary method in our Design Research. In contrast, methods such as surveys would not be as helpful here as interview because they are more anonymous and restrict participants to a subset of predetermined answer options. Our method is primarily to conduct interviews with experts in sustainable eating, restaurant owners as well as grocery shoppers. We wrote a specific interview script with detailed questions we follow, conducted, recorded the interviews and took notes. In the interview script, we had two subsets of questions where one set of them is demographic about their background and another set is primary regarding our topic in sustainable eating. The first one with Amanda went very effectively and we learned a lot from the interview, so we decided to continue the interview approach with the rest of our participants. Each of them we had a different interview script and questions centering around the participants’ background and our goals for that participant. 

#### Design Research Participants
Based on the plan, we interviewed three participants including Amanda as the expert in the field, Beth as the sustainable restaurant owner and Betty as the grocery shopper.

##### “Amanda”
Amanda is a student studying environmental science at UW that we interviewed in person on campus. She was definitely an expert in the field, an intern for 21 Acres (a center for sustainable agriculture in Washington), and involved in the sustainability community. We interviewed Amanda to get an expert opinion on the most important aspects of eating sustainably, as well as to get a sense of someone on a budget approaches sustainable buying and eating habits. 

##### “Beth”
Beth is the head chef at Terra Plata, a Seattle restaurant with a significant focus on sustainability. We conducted an interview with her over the phone, with the goal of figuring out what an eco-minded restaurateur prioritizes when both buying produce and creating a menu.

##### “Betty”
Betty is a UW student living in Lander who does not normally consider sustainability when making decisions around food, but is interested to learn more about sustainable eating. We conducted an interview with her face-to-face, with a focus on finding out what kinds of sustainable eating habits that she felt were the most achievable.

#### Design Research Results and Themes
After conducting our interviews we were able to significantly narrow down our project scope.  The overall problem of sustainable eating was able to be broken down into four main pain points: consuming too much red meat, not buying food locally, not buying food in season, and wasting food.  Since our target audience is young people, we wanted to focus on problems that would have a low barrier of entry.  Buying food in season and reducing food waste were both problems that, when solved, would also benefit individuals making the behavior change (by costing them less money), so we decided to investigate those further.

**Reducing red meat consumption.** One of the first things Amanda did to eat more sustainably was to cut red meat out of her diet. She told us that is by far the most consuming form of produce by far, and our own research has since borne that out. Red meat is responsible for 10 to 40 times as many greenhouse gasses as vegetarian produce, with cows in particular being responsible for up to 20% of all methane production. Unfortunately, we also found that getting people to reduce their red meat consumption to be largely infeasible. Beth, who puts a strong focus on sustainably sourcing her restaurant, still put burgers on her menu because she needed them to attract a wider base of eaters. Betty similarly said that going off of red meat would not be a lifestyle change she would be willing to make. 

**Buying food locally and in season.** One of the major things that we learned from participants is that buying food locally in season is one of the preferred and easier practices for them to be more sustainable. Because buying locally and eating in season does not significantly require much change in people’s eating habits. Moreover, we learned from Amanda that food transporting from other regions and countries, and food out of season(requires special temperature and light) contributes greatly to the carbon emissions. 

**Reducing food waste.** Beth described reducing food waste as the primary way she tries to stay sustainable. She said that she tries to use every part of every ingredient she buys so that none of it goes to waste. She also keeps a close eye on the leftovers that come back to her kitchen, actively adjusting the portion sizes of her dishes to minimize how much her food gets thrown out. Wasted food is responsible for 6.7% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions2, so this is indeed an important way to improve our food sustainability. Betty also said that reducing food waste would be the lifestyle change she would be the most willing to make, which tells us that there is perhaps a better market for designs in this theme than the other two.

### Identified Tasks
Based on our design research, we decided on six tasks that we felt our design should strive to handle. The tasks themselves are bold.

**Figuring out what needs to be discarded.** Based on the research, we learned that one problem with food waste is that expiry dates are often conservative. Many foods can still be consumed after their expiration date, but not everyone knows this, so they may end up throwing away perfectly good food.  

**Sharing food with others.** In the interviews, our expert and shopper both mentioned that they sometimes share food with their roommates before it goes bad, so we felt that making sharing food easier would be a good way to reduce food waste. Thus, because of its effectiveness and convenience for people to practice, we identify this task.

**Buying produce in season.** The chef in particular said that she prioritized buying food produce that is in season above all else when deciding what ingredients to stock. This is both more sustainable as well as more cost effective. Moreover, we learned from Amanda that food out of season(requires special temperature and light) contributes greatly to the carbon emissions. 
Because of how effective it is for promoting sustainability and the convenience for people to practice based on our research, we identify this task. 

**Check and remember food expiration dates.**  Based on our research, we learned a common trend that almost all participants often forget to check on their food, and food is often found spoiled too late. Thus, almost all participants want to solve this problem. Because of how common the problem is and the strong desire for people to change, we identify this task.

**Using food before it spoils.** Betty mentioned that she sometimes forgets what she has in the fridge until it's too late, so actively encouraging people to use their food before it spoils seemed like a good way to prevent this. This also aligns with our goal of the “check and remember food expiration dates” task so we identify the task. 

**Figuring out what to buy while at the grocery store and buying the right amount of food.** Based on our research, we learned that one important way to reduce food waste is to not have too much food in the first place. This would likely mean getting people to be judicious when figuring out what and how much to get at the grocery store. 

### Proposed Design Sketches

#### Design 1: Smartphone App
This design is an awesome app that helps reduce food waste, increases sustainability awareness and supports various functions. First, users could input their food data at home --- either by manually entering the product, scanning the barcode or by ML image recognition. After having all the available data and the exact expiration date, to prevent waste, the app reminds users (through notification)  when their food is about to expire (customizable). In addition to avoiding food waste, the app allows users to share any unused and extra food with others through social media. What’s more, the app gives users recommendations for similar in-season food when the food they are looking at buying is out-of-season.

#### Design 2: Smart Fridge with “Fridgigotchi” 
The idea behind the smart fridge is to keep track of what is currently in the refrigerator and use that to make suggestions for groceries or recipies. Sensors would track how full the fridge is (pressure sensors on each shelf) and what is going bad (gas sensors). The fridge would also be able to scan barcodes to more precisely know what it contains. The smart fridge would also have a large interactive screen display that can be used to get information about the food. A calendar to show estimated time to expiration, grocery suggestions based on what has been in the fridge in the past, and suggestions for recipes based on what is in the fridge now would all be display options. A fun, tamagotchi-like display (“Fridgigotchi”) would also be used to show what is going bad and should be eaten now.

#### Design 3: Grocery Store Kiosk
This design is a smart grocery kiosk that promotes sustainability, minimizes food waste and provides customers with interesting information of relevant food data. The kiosk also contains the users’ previous purchase information and data. With this user data, the user can put their food in the kiosk to scan.  The kiosk will remind them if they just bought the same food a few days ago and give users a moment to reflect on if they actually need the food. In addition, by scanning the food, the kiosk provides information about this food such as what period of time in a year this kind of food is in season and how far it traveled to get to the store. What is more, with this rich user data, the kiosk can make suggestions based on the user’s purchasing habits.

### Selected Design and Storyboards
#### Why We Selected this Design
We decided to move forward with the Fridgigotchi design because we like the physical aspect of the smart fridge and the cute aspect of Fridgigotchi. We got feedback such as the fact that you cannot always see food spoiling, so it is good to have some sort of visual indicator.  Another comment was that portraying food like Tamagotchis is effective because the emotion related to seeing animate objects suffer will drive people to take action, rather than just seeing their food as inanimate objects.  We are interested in exploring the lifelike aspect of food since this is something that seems to be relatively unexplored, compared to smartphone apps on reducing food waste.  We think that creating a more emotional connection with the food will help motivate people to pay more attention to the food in their fridge.

#### Scenario 1: 
John is living on his own for the first time and is learning how to manage the food in his fridge.  Since he often spontaneously goes out to eat, leftovers and groceries often sit in his fridge, rotting, without him noticing.  John realizes that he has been wasting a lot of food by letting it spoil, so he invests in a Fridgigotchi.  Since Fridgigotchi is displayed prominently on John’s fridge, he can “see” what is going on in his fridge simply by entering the kitchen.  John can see when Fridgigotchi is suffering.  Even when John does not know what is in his fridge, Fridgigotchi does, so it shows him what needs to be discarded, so John can safely discard the right foods.

#### Scenario 2:
John ends up throwing away a lot of food because his fridge is often a random assortment of ingredients he does not quite know what to do with.  These random foods often end up getting thrown out because John does not know how to combine them into anything useful.  John invests in a Fridgigotchi to help him.  Fridgigotchi tells John what foods are about to expire and suggests recipes for how to use different combinations of them.
