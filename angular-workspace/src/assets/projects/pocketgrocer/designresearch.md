### Problem & Solution

In the United States, up to 40% - or around 70 million tons - of food produced is wasted, costing around $220 billion a year. For the average 4-person family, this costs them around $1500 per year. Globally, food waste is around 33%, with more developed countries having higher percentages of food wasted.

Food waste in the U.S. is an important issue because of its impact on our economy and the environment. Besides being expensive in terms of opportunity cost, there are further environmental impacts due to depletion of land agriculture, natural resources, and freshwater supplies. In addition, rotting food in landfills is a major source of methane emissions, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change at about 30 times the potency as carbon dioxide. Lastly, wasted food results in a smaller food supply, raising costs for consumers. Because food is necessary for survival and generally regarded as a human right, excessive food waste can contribute to the poor and disadvantaged being denied the right to feed themselves.

Current solutions exist to reduce or prevent food waste, but they address different stages of the farm-to-table process. Companies like Misfits Market, Imperfect Produce, and Hungry Harvest ship “ugly produce" that are rejected from supermarkets directly to consumers to minimize wasted produce. Smart fridges are also used to automatically track personal inventory, but these are often impractical and expensive, costing over $2000 for a new appliance that is usually already present in most people’s homes.

### Design Research: Goals, Methods, Participants

We conducted our design research with the goal of understanding specific grocery shopping habits of our various participants, focusing in particular on discovering which habits led to wasted food for each individual. Because our problem spanned a range of populations -- essentially any household that utilizes a fridge -- our research focused on how individual habits uniquely contributed to each individual’s food waste.

To encapsulate the largest span of this diverse population, our participants included:

- **Jim (pseudonym):** A college student living in a small shared household, shares a fridge and mostly shops for individual groceries
- **Sam (pseudonym):** A college student living in a large shared household, shares a fridge and mostly shops for individual groceries
- **Jody (pseudonym):** A mom of a family of five, shopping and cooking for the whole family
- **Lily (pseudonym):** A college student living in a single studio apartment, shopping and cooking for themselves without sharing any groceries

By capturing a diversity of household sizes and who the participants are shopping for, we hoped to maximize the variation in responses and discover a greater range of grocery habits.

We initially started with contextual inquiries to understand each participant’s spending habits, in particular seeking out what tradeoffs participants made when deciding which groceries to purchase. After observing participants one and two while grocery shopping, though, we learned that the physical grocery store environment had little impact on their eventual shopping habits, and so we instead turned to interviews for participants three and four.

Lastly, in addition to these interviews and observations, we asked participants to log diary entries of their food waste over a period of about five days; the goal of these logs were to identify how a specific shopping habit might lead to a certain amount or type of food wasted. In the end, these diary logs did not provide much insight into patterns of food waste in large part due to the short period of time, but also because many individuals were already fairly aware and conscious of wasting food.

### Design Research: Results and Themes

Following our design research, we realized that despite the variety of participants involved in our research, they each identified the same main challenges:

- **Difficulty keeping track food items:** All of our participants mentioned difficulties in tracking what food items they currently had at home. Jody would frequently call her kids to ask what was in the fridge, and Jim would stop in the middle of the grocery store to think back to what he could remember seeing in his fridge. This meant that participants would end up forgetting to repurchase items that they ran out of, or end up with too many items that they rarely used: Jody specifically mentioned that they had three bags of brown sugar because since she rarely used it, she would forget that they already had enough.

- **Knowing how to use up food:** As a follow-up to the difficulties in tracking their current foods, participants also discussed how they would struggle to think of ways to use up the foods they had. Much of their new grocery purchases would be dependent on how to create new meals that would use up their leftover food items, and so the challenge of using up foods involves both meal ideation, as well as tracking how much of what food item they still had for these new meals.

- **Lack of planning before grocery shopping:** As both students and working adults, all the participants rarely planned their grocery shopping ahead of time: they would fit in a stop at the store whenever and wherever they could. This lack of planning contributed to their difficulty in keeping track of their groceries, and so we knew our design would need to be efficient and convenient to integrate into their existing lifestyle and grocery shopping practices.

- **Awareness of their food waste:** Lastly, each participant was already aware of their food waste, and wanted to avoid unnecessarily throwing away food items. Jim explicitly cited that Trader Joe’s excessive plastic packaging bothered him, and Sam mentioned her own preference towards environmentally-friendly produce (e.g. locally-sourced and organic). This meant that our problem and proposed solution to minimize food waste was desired by our population, and that individuals would be interested in more effective ways to practice better habits.

These insights were realized mostly from the interviews and contextual inquiry, as we asked specifically about what their goals were while grocery shopping and how they managed their food items. Although the diary logs were interesting to understand how much food was wasted for each participant, it did not help us to identify specific patterns or trends that led to wasted food.

### Tasks

Although each participant went about their grocery shopping differently than the others, they all shared tasks that were common practice regardless of where they shopped, or what their goals were while grocery shopping.

- **Task 1: Keeping track of current groceries at home**

  Having an inventory of groceries at home is important so that users do not buy excess amounts of a food item. Our participants usually called a friend or family member at home to coordinate their shopping trips.

- **Task 2: Choosing new groceries to incorporate with current groceries**

  Part of the difficulty of using up extra food is finding ways to prepare it in different ways. During shopping trips, participants reported trying to find new ingredients that could be prepared with old ingredients in order to use up existing inventory.

- **Task 3: Measuring shelf life of foods and how long it will take to consume items**

  Shelf lives vary based on food, and it is difficult to tell if a food item is close to going bad besides using smell/appearance, which is impractical for large inventories. Our participants stated that they forgot about what was expiring sometimes.

- **Task 4: Clearing out foods that have gone bad**

  Clearing foods that have gone bad requires being able to track which foods have gone bad. Being able to measure shelf life of foods would also help track which foods have gone bad and thus allow participants to clear these food items out.

- **Task 5: Sharing excess food to prevent wasting food and money**

  Sharing food that is about to go bad allows less food to be wasted. Participants in non-family shared households wanted to borrow their roommates’ food at times and were willing to share their own excess food.

- **Task 6: Prioritizing fresh produce that participants want**

  Individuals want to be able to find the products they eat all the time, but there is never a reliable way to know what stores will have what they want. Often-times, they never go home with the groceries they intend to purchase.

### Design Sketches

#### Design 1: Organization and Food Storage
This first design utilizes a basket or placemat design that users could place into their fridge to organize their food items by category. These baskets and placemats would track the item’s mass over time, and allow users to check in real-time exactly what food item they had at that exact moment, and also display their food waste trends, utilizing a mobile app to display this information. Additionally, it could provide possible recipes based on the exact food and amount they had available to them in their fridge.

#### Design 2: Digital Grocery List
This design utilizes a mobile app that would allow users to track their groceries and know exactly when each item was purchased. Users could take a picture of their receipt after grocery shopping, and the app would digitize their receipt, knowing exactly what was purchased and on what day. It would also have a “food friend" feature where you could add friends that also used the app, and indicate which of your foods are shared and see which of their foods are shared. This compiles a holistic grocery inventory based on your purchases, as well as what other items are shared for you to use. Thus, users could know exactly what was available to them and when they were purchased.

#### Design 3: Food Waste Tracker
This mobile app addresses the tail end of groceries by tracking how old foods are, and highlighting which items are expiring soon. It would prompt you whenever foods are expiring soon or have already gone bad, as determined by the expected expiration date, sending a notification to prompt you to clean out your food. It would also provide visualizations for users to see their exact food waste trends by week or month, as well as a “month in review" to see how much of what was wasted.

### Selected Design & Storyboards

Overall, the most practical design we chose that could accommodate the tasks we listed was a mobile app (combining both grocery recording and expiry date tracking features from designs 1 and 3). An app provided more flexibility in recording and analyzing data than an individual device like the placemats in design 2. Additionally, users would be able to coordinate grocery shopping trips with their inventory at home just by using their phone, which many participants already use to either record their grocery list or call home to double check items. Thus, a mobile app was the most easy to integrate into the participants’ everyday lifestyle.

#### Storyboard 1
A shopper goes about their usual grocery routine, purchasing items they would usually buy during each trip. Instead of trying to recall what they still have at home or calling someone to check their fridge and pantry, the shopper can refer to their phone as they walk through the store themselves. They can check for when the last time they purchased a certain grocery item, and use this to decide what items they will need to repurchase or what else they can buy to supplement their current items. After checking out, they can take a photo of their receipt and the app will record all the new items purchased on that trip, updating the purchase date and predicted expiration dates.

#### Storyboard 2
As foods get old and their expiration date approaches, the mobile app will send a notification to remind individuals about these items. It can then offer ways of disposing the food as well as the food’s packaging, and they can see how much of food they have thrown away over time. As the app is used more and more, it can suggest more optimal purchase amounts for each food item that is thrown away.
