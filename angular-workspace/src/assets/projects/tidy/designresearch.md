### Overview

Tidy's primary objective  is to optimize and simplify household management among shared living spaces such as dorms, apartments, and houses. In many of these living situations, the lack of an authority figure and/or individual accountability often leads to disorganized shared spaces, miscommunication, and tension among roommates or housemates. A household management platform such as Tidy would not only increase the livability of a household, but also alleviate potential disputes and help to maintain relationships. Aspects of shared living that Tidy addresses include chore delegation, finance management, scheduling, and communication.

Our solution to these household issues takes the form of a smartphone application, which leverages the feasibility and universal adoption of smartphones. Because household members are not home for a significant portion of the day, we needed our design to be both portable and convenient to access at all times. This property allows us to maximize the utility of features such as messaging and expense management. While other proposed designs such as a smartboard or smartwatch have their advantages, we believe that an all-in-one smartphone application for household management will ultimately allow for the greatest balance of both convenience and performance. 

### Design Research Approach

Although all Tidy members have experienced shared living in our college career, our knowledge regarding this broad topic was still extremely limited. As a result, the primary goal for our design research was to gather a comprehensive collection of data and observations across a wide variety of living situations, including dorms, shared apartments, and even families. We further diversified our research by considering a range of roommate and housemate relationships, from best friends to former strangers.  Our research focused on these aspects of shared living: type of living situation, household chores, roommate relationships, conflict resolution, technology aids, and roommate relationships.

We chose to conduct semi-structured interviews as our primary design research method. The main advantage of interviews was the level of depth and detail it allowed for, especially in regards to specific household practices and circumstances. Although we initially considered contextual inquiries or focus groups, we decided that most of the relevant insight they would offer in regards to our problem space could also be obtained in an interview setting. To ensure that participants would be comfortable sharing about sensitive topics such as household conflict and roommate tension, we planned most of our interviews in a one-on-one setting. This gave participants the ability to confidentially discuss issues regarding other roommates, with the guarantee that their responses would not be shared or used outside of our design research process. To minimize the effect of personal bias on our research analysis, we scheduled separate interviews for multiple members of the same household to ensure well-rounded responses.

### Design Research Results

Our design research revealed a number of common patterns, most of which stemmed from a lack of household organization. Key insights and themes included chores being divided agreeably but not equally, disagreements on household standards, and a lack of proper organizational tools. These insights helped to inform our design direction and were derived directly from the various perspectives we gathered during the interview process.

**Chores are divided agreeably, but not equally.** In most of our interviews, we found that chore workload was not being fairly divided among housemates, but rather in a way that was most easily agreed upon. One interviewee noted that "It is hard to force someone to do something. Sometimes you just end up doing their chores for them or saying 'lets do it together'". Often times, one or two individuals end up taking on more of the burden. Chore assignments are typically determined verbally and managed mentally, which can make it difficult to come to a fair agreement that can also be easily maintained between all of the roommates.

**Agreeing upon standards and guidelines for clean living.** When roommates do not share a fundamental understanding of what it means for the house to be clean deciding who does what becomes very messy. Imagine a situation where Sandra believes cleaning the bathroom to involve wiping down the counters and sink, scrubbing the toilet and shower, and mopping the floors, but Jimmy thinks that it is just replacing the toilet paper and making sure the toilet is not clogged. These differences in opinion introduce a lot of complexity in deciding who does what. Maybe you have to avoid having Jimmy cleaning the bathroom because you know he will not do it well, or Sandra ends up having to do extra work when she is assigned dishes but then the bathroom is a mess when she goes to use it. During an interview an interviewee had noted "People have different standards or definitions of what constitutes clean, so if the app could outline standards or guidelines that would be helpful."

**Combinations of tools not meant for managing a household are lacking.** Very commonly our interviewees were using a combination of facebook messenger and venmo as their primary means of managing their household. Both of these tools have the foundational abilities to facilitate communication and financial transactions between roommates respectively but lack organization for managing a household. One continuous communication stream makes it hard to remember how it was agreed who would do what, needing to scroll all the way back to when it was decided to remember who does what. Similarly manually dividing up costs and sending individual requests is cumbersome, letting shared expenses slip through the cracks because they are too small to care about. Adding extra structure as wrappers to these tools that supply the foundational abilities is something that all of our interviews saw as something useful.

### Tasks

- *Establishing Household Standards/Guidelines*

  **People have differing opinions in regards to what "clean" entails - thus, it is important to have clear household standards and guidelines.** Many of our participants did not have clearly defined roles in the household which led to sporadic completion of chores by random housemates. While this method may thrive in living situations where housemates are close friends, we found that it was often a primary source of housemate disagreement and conflict.

- *Maintaining Accountability*

  **Lack of an authoritative figure leads to accountability issues.** Multiple participants mentioned that house members who do not pull their weight ultimately force others to carry their burden and complete their responsibilities. This could lead to passive aggressive confrontations between roommates and can strain relationships within the living space.

- *Assigning Chores Based on Preference*

  **Certain members of a household may prefer one chore over another.** In our research, we discovered that there were typically imbalances in household chore workloads. While this problem can be partially explained by a lack of accountability, we were interested in finding additional explanations to account for this imbalance. If members of a household are better suited to doing a specific chore over another, they could be better motivated to complete their assigned responsibilities.

- *Tracking Shared Expenses*

  **Tracking shared household expenses in a clear and transparent manner.** We discovered through our interviews that money was a primary focus across our participant pool. All households had some form of shared expenses, such as groceries, cleaning supplies, or rent/utilities. Applications such as Venmo and Google Sheets were commonly utilized by our participants to manage shared finances, which motivated us to incorporate a feature that allowed for both tracking and paying for shared expenses.

- *Schedule Considerations*

  **Considering individual schedules in regards to chore distribution and overall household management.** Because a majority of our participants were young working adults and students, their schedules were typically busy. Considering the daily schedules of users in order to fairly distribute the household workload was thus an important consideration. Participants also appreciated when their roommates let them know beforehand when guests would be over.

- *Maintaining Positive Housemate Relationships*

  **Minimizing housemate conflict and strained relationships stemming from poor household management.** Some of our participants had issues with their roommates that resulted from a lack of accountability and poor management of the living space. There were often passive aggressive interactions between roommates and some had difficulty with confrontation which progressed these interactions further.

### Design Sketches
The following illustrations depict three design directions that were considered during our ideation phase. The first design represents a mobile app concept, followed by a reimagined home "smartboard", and a robotic companion that monitors chore completion status.

#### Mobile App

Our smartphone application design serves as a hub for a variety of household-related functions. This app allows users to check the completion status of certain chores, as well as the housemate responsible for completing the chore. Communication is another primary focus of this design - as a result, the app includes a messaging feature that allows roommates to send quick reminders or updates to one another. Finally, the app serves as an analytics and monitoring tool for shared household expenses. Shared transactions would be transparent to all household members, and notifications would alert members of their current dues or charges.

#### Smartboard 

This design reimagines the common whiteboarding experience that many households still use to manage their homes. The smartboard aims to preserve the traditional writing experience while also allowing users to swap between multiple interfaces. One of the primary features of this design is that users would be able to leave anonymous comments on the board, serving as a non-aggressive way to remind roommates to do something. Moreover, because this would be a digital experience, users wouldn't have to worry about their comments being accidentally erased as the smartboard can autosave important information. Similar to the mobile app, the smartboard also comes equipped with additional features and interfaces such as scheduling, finances, and chore delegation.

<p style="text-align: center">Figure 2. Smartboard sketch showcasing multiple interfaces and ability to write comments.</p>

#### Mr. Clean

Our final design concept was rather outlandish and bold, but it addresses an aspect of shared living that often generates conflict. Introducing Mr. Clean, your new robotic roommate. Mr. Clean serves as a 3rd-party household mediator, primarily functioning to preserve the peace by alleviating the pressure of roommate confrontation. Mr. Clean routinely patrols the house and scans high priority rooms such as the bathroom, kitchen, and living room. If Mr. Clean detects a messy environment, he will actively seek the roommate responsible for maintaining that specific room and remind them to do their chores. Mr. Clean will also remind members of household cleaning standards if they consistently underperform. This design seeks to eliminate passive aggressive confrontation between roommates by leveraging an unbiased, fact-based system.

### Selected Design

Moving forward we chose to expand on the app design for managing households. The app would mainly hold two functions of allowing each member of the household to view the chores that they have to complete and view the share of the expenses that they owe towards managing the household. In addition, the app would have other subfunctions to help in maintaining the chore structure and financials. We chose to pursue this design over the smart board and the robot helper/mediator. One reason was because we knew from the interviews that most were expecting an app to be developed to help them manage the house. In addition, we knew most users would not want to invest too much money into managing their household and the robot or smart board would be seen as a much greater investment than an app.

### Storyboards

#### Chore Accountability
In this storyboard, we can see the user using the app to maintain accountability with completing chores. First, we see that the dishes have not been completed yet. Then, we see the person who was assigned the chore get a notification reminding them to complete the chore. Having seen the alert the user goes and completes the chore. Then after the chore is completed, they take a picture to verify that it was completed.

#### Shared Expense Tracking
In this storyboard we outline how the app would be used to help maintain financial accountability in the household. First, one of the users in the household notices that some shared items in the kitchen have been used up. So, the user heads to the store and purchases the shared items. After purchasing the items, the user inputs what he bought and the other roommates are notified of the new expense.
