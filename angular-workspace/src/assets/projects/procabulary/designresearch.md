### 1. Problem and Solution Overview
There exists an implicit onboarding process in specialized fields of work. Not only is there a standard training process for new employees, there is a second, hidden one as well. This hidden process is the understanding of technical jargon in that field, especially in professional contexts. Our problem is how do we speed up this process, or, in other words, how do we get people to master sophisticated and specialized jargons and information in professional industries at a quicker pace. Per the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US economy added 176,000 jobs every month in 2019. The expanding workforce and relentless onboarding that occurs for professionals exacerbates this problem.

Our solution to the problem lies in utilizing continuous speech capture technology. People can track their own speech as well as those of their colleagues to better understand technical jargon and integrate it into their own speech. The solution is a wearable app pair: There is a feature on a smartwatch paired with a smartphone app. The primary purpose of the wearable is for speech capture when prompted, and the smartphone app offers insights, analysis, and ways to improve their vernacular, both through understanding new words and eventually using those words in their specialized field.

### 2. Design Research Goals, Methods, and Participants
The focus of our design research was on gaining a deeper understanding of what conversational issues people new to a certain professional environment face, and what they do to overcome it, so that we can use continuous speech capture to assist with the process. 

We considered many different approaches to carry out or research, ultimately deciding to conduct interviews. This made sense because it allowed us to provide participants with a safe environment to articulate and comfortably discuss the problems they face on a daily basis in natural language, a highly personal topic.

Our design should be versatile enough so that it can be used by people in any profession, regardless of their niche. In other words, we want to be able to help not only beginner computer scientists, but also amateur plumbers. In an effort to cover this wide spectrum, we decided to interview an art student, a lawyer, a biology student, and a business student.

Initially, we were also concerned about technical communication across different languages, for example a German-speaking and Hindi-speaking mathematician trying to communicate at some conference, and finding a solution for that as well. However, after the first couple interviews, we discovered that this wasnâ€™t a big problem, a finding supported by a lot of our secondary research, and so pivoted away from trying to solve any translational problems.

### 3. Design Research Results and Themes
Despite the vastly different background of each research participant, many common needs and practices came up, allowing us to critically breakdown and identify common opportunities. A fundamental pain point for everyone was the difficulty they faced in understanding the technical lingo of an environment they were new to, and expanding their knowledge base, and then subsequently incorporating all of this in their own speech.

**People initially had trouble comprehending the sophisticated jargon unique to their specific environment.** A young art student spoke about the challenges she faced, saying "There are literally thousands of different technical adjectives in art, and you have to know exactly how each one is different from another while critiquing, which really caused me problems when I was a newbie artist." Similar frustrations were expressed by all our participants.

**The issue of collecting new information from intellectual discussions with peers in their respective fields was also universally expressed across all our participants.** "Very often, in meetings with my boss, I would still be fully processing something he said earlier, and so miss out on some crucial information he said later on", exasperated the business student.

**The process of incorporating technical lingo consistently in your own everyday speech is rather slow.** Even after our participants felt like they got the hang of the workplace vernacular, their own speech was still not professional enough by some standards, and had room for improvement. "It took me awhile to start using technical words and ideas in the lab confidently, and in the correct context. The process was slow, and in hindsight, I wish I had some help speeding it up". This desire to 'sound smart' in front of their peers was similarly expressed across all our interviews.

**Lastly, people were also seemingly curious about similarities and differences in their speech among different settings of daily conversation.** "I would love to gain a better understanding of how I talk differently at work and at home. What are the things I say to clients, and what are the things I say to my grandma. I wonder if there are some specific words I use a lot in some situations but not in others." said the lawyer we interviewed. A similar curiosity was found even in some other participants.
These were the results that came out of our design research process.

### 4. Identified Tasks
We have summarized main pain points that were mentioned during interviews with our potential targets as well as from our initial design research. After analyzing our research and interview results, we designed 6 tasks that embody the objectives our targets want to accomplish and particular needs they have. 

**Task 1: Identify and compile new terms and vocabulary.** Four interviewees all expressed their concerns to quickly comprehend and extract important terms in fast-paced intellectual discussions. Hence, we think it is fairly important to design this task to help our potential target identify and organize new terms and vocabulary.

**Task 2: Review and study identified vocabulary.** The majority of our interviewees, when being asked about memorizing new terms and keywords, told us that they have to force themselves to review and memorize them constantly, otherwise they will quickly forget those words completely. 

**Task 3: Integrate vocabulary into daily conversations.** Although all of our interviewees acknowledged that remembering and integrating newly-gathered information into their speech is a natural process, they worried that the entire process is too slow to be practical without any external forces. They also identified that they constantly find it difficult to naturally incorporate those words to appropriate contexts when talking with other professionals.

**Task 4: Identify places for improvements.** In our design research, we noticed that a lot of our interviewees, even though they have spent time reviewing and extracting important information, they always lack a clear goal to enhance and hone their skills, not sure where they are and where they are heading to. This makes their effort less effective and leaves it in vain. 

**Task 5: Reflect on changes and progress.**  Through our design research, we discovered that incentivizing and personalizing learning experience triggers powerful human emotions, particularly fulfillment, encouragement and interests. Reinforcing good behaviors and improvements by offering small, staged rewards, even small psychological rewards, can help users accomplish their goals one by one and create a sense of achievement for them to proceed further. According to the statistics demonstrated by TalentLMS [1], 81% of respondents said that the reward system increases their engagement and gives them encouragement for future learning.

**Task 6: Draw connections among different settings of daily conversations**. Throughout our interviews with our potential target users, we noticed that people have particular need to "translate" speeches in their professional areas to speeches aiming for people without professional knowledge. As our interviewees mentioned, every time before conversations, they need to spend a long time thinking carefully about how to use plain language to properly communicate in front of people outside their industry but always fail to achieve this by unconsciously assuming other people understand what he/she is talking about with professional languages.

### 5. Proposed Design Sketches 
**Design 1: Wearable - Mobile Learning App Pair**

This wearable-mobile app pair especially focuses on collecting new information from conversations and learning the newly-gathered information.Learners can tap the record button on the wearable screen to start recording and stop the recording by tapping again. The recording will then be analyzed, jargons from this field will be presented in a manner that is easy to comprehend and memorize, integrating methods such as relational diagrams, flashcards and quizzes. Meaning, frequency of the words mentioned, and common usage will be presented if one clicks the word bubble. Playbacks of each word are also provided for the learner to get a sense of the context the new words are used. See *Figure.1* below for details.

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Figure 1: Wearable-Learning App Pair</b></p>

**Design 2: Speech Improvement Mobile App**

The speech improvement mobile app is more focused on helping people learn how to use words in the correct context and tracking their every step along the speech improvement journey. The design of the app combines the idea of personal training apps and Grammarly. Users can build a profile, provide the information on their current fluency in their areas, and what they wish to achieve. A timeline will then be generated for the users to present a clear visualization of their speech improvement journey. The users can tap the record button on the lower menu to start recording. The written version of their speech will be presented on the speech, there will also be suggestions on some words or framing of sentences to make the speech more appropriate in the given context. The advice may come from the speech of professionals that the users talk to, or external sources. Details are given in *Figure.2*.

**Design 3: Wearable and Audio Analysis on Desktop**

The wearable is specifically designed and equipped with audio recording capability. Users are able to proactively activate the audio recording by pressing the start button on the wearable and stop recording at any time by pressing the button again. The audio then will be sent to and analyzed on the registered PC or Mac securely. All related and emphasized topics will be extracted from the audio clips and listed on the front page by their frequency and importance. This allows users to quickly pinpoint the topic/area they want to review afterwards. Each topic includes a keyword list and a corresponding list of brief summaries according to the fields, realms that users select. By clicking the keyword, the user is able to review playbacks in which the keyword is mentioned as well as other tangible related materials.

### 6. Selected Design and Storyboards

We chose to combine the second design and third design. Together, these two designs address a majority of goals we identified from our participants: pinpointing new terms and vocabularies, reviewing and getting familiarized with those new words/info and evaluating their progress. The combined design contains a wearable to support audio recording as well as a smartphone for data presentation. Smartphones make analysis and reflection on those captured data much easier, and wearable allows for a less intrusive method of continuous speech capture. From our design research, most of our participants tend to become rusty on certain words as time goes by. The combined design aims to facilitate learning and proactively reactive memory in the correct context. 

**Scenario 1: Compiling new terms/vocabulary and review the identified words**

Peter is a new lawyer, and the conferences and hearings he needs to attend are always lengthy. Even though there are always audio recordings, it is time-consuming to listen to the entire recording aimlessly to gather the most instructive information. He wants to quickly capture the keywords and juristic theories so that he is able to draw some parallels from them. After researching online, he decided to give Procabulary a shot. On the other day, he recorded the hearing that he attended using his smart watch. The material was then transferred to ProCabulary and analyzed thoroughly. A brief summary of the court hearing, and a list of extracted keywords were presented in the app. The order of the keyword list was based on the frequency those words were mentioned, and he can check out the definition, common usage, and playback audios of the mentioned keywords. Peter was glad that he discovered ProCabulary, for it could not only save him tons of time going through the lengthy recordings, but also help him capture those keywords with ease.

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Figure 4: Storyboard for Scenario 1</b></p>

**Scenario 2: Identifying places for improvement and track oneâ€™s progress**

Jason is a Ph.D. student who majors in transportation engineering, but he wants to pursue a career in the consulting industry. As a non-native speaker, he finds the transition to be quite challenging. A friend highly recommended him try out ProCabulary to improve his speech, so he purchased the premium plan. He set up his profile, specifying his current fluency in consulting, and his goal (to sound like a professional consultant). The other day, Jason recorded the conversation with a client by using the recording app on his apple watch. What he said during the meeting was extracted and presented in ProCabulary. Several suggestions regarding his word choice were provided, for example, "I'm available " to be rephrased as "I will have bandwidth to take on this project," and "get the senior person engaged in my idea" be replaced by "gain traction." With the advice provided by ProCabulary, Jason's speech became more appropriate for the consulting setting. Jason was glad that he could find a tool that helps him incorporate the consulting glossary into his language.
