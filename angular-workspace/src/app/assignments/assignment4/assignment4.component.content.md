</div>

## Overview

You have identified a problem, explored a design space, selected a promising design, and iterated on that design.
It is now time to focus on communicating your design and your design process.
This group assignment communicates your design through a __poster__ and a __video prototype__.

## Milestones

This is a group assignment, consisting of six milestones.

## Deliverables

### 4a: Initial Poster and Pitch

<app-assignment-due-text dueText="{{ page.due_project_4a }}"></app-assignment-due-text>

The goal of this milestone is to create a poster and a pitch that communicate your design to a broad audience.

Create a poster that communicates your design and your design process.
Present your work in a visual form that quickly conveys its most important aspects. 
Your poster should include:

- Project Title
- Logo
- Your Names
- Problem
- Value Proposition
- Key Functionality
- Design Process and Iteration

Your poster should emphasize images and include limited amounts of text.
For consistency and ease of display, it should be 32"x40" (i.e., portrait, vertical). 
A PowerPoint template is available here:

[Cow Project PowerPoint template](/assets/samples/4a/poster_template.ppt)

You should heavily modify the template to be unique and represent your project.

During the final poster session, your team will give a one minute pitch to a small group of judges. 
Create a pitch that summarizes the problem and your design.
This pitch should convince an audience that your problem was worth investigating and that your design suggests a compelling direction.

#### Submission

Submit your poster via Canvas here: 

<app-assignment-submission-link linkSubmission="{{ page.link_project_4a }}"></app-assignment-submission-link>

Due to challenges that frequently arise in printing, submit both:

- a PDF a your poster
- the source file for your poster (e.g., PPT, PPTX)

**In-Class Exercise**: 
In addition to your submission, bring two 8.5"x11" printed copies of your poster to class (i.e., color prints on normal-sized paper).
You will need these for in-class critique.

#### Contribution Statement

<app-assignment-contribution-statement></app-assignment-contribution-statement>

#### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __10 points__:

- __Content__: (5 points)
  - Includes all of the key content listed above
  - Key functionality of the design is clear
  - Gives insight into the design process
- __Clarity and Presentation__: (5 points)
  - Appropriately large images that convey key aspects of the design
  - Test is minimal and appropriate, large and legible
  - Colors and fonts are a pleasing combination and easy to read

Your poster should be complete and will be evaluated as such.
Later critique and refinement will help further improve it before a final version.

### 4b: Initial Video

<app-assignment-due-text dueText="{{ page.due_project_4b }}"></app-assignment-due-text>

The goal of this milestone is to create a video that communicates your design to a broad audience.

Working from your prior storyboards or new storyboards, create a video that illustrates your proposed design. 
Be sure your video conveys all of:
   
   - the problem
   - the design
   - the context 
   - the satisfaction
   
Refer to the examples provided in lecture, as well as videos from prior classes, for insights into creating an effective video.

Your video must not be more than 2 minutes long. It is critical that your video be short enough to remain engaging while delivering its content.

You are required to include appropriate captions for the accessibility of your video. 
The staff has prepared simple instructions on how to do that using a script of your video together with YouTube's captioning tools:

<div class="alert alert-danger" markdown="1">
<p>[https://canvas.uw.edu/files/53767196/download?download_frd=1](https://canvas.uw.edu/files/53767196/download?download_frd=1)</p>`
</div>

Be sure to check the quality of the resulting captions and correct them as necessary.

### 4c: Final Poster and Pitch

<app-assignment-due-text dueText="{{ page.due_project_4c }}"></app-assignment-due-text>

Appropriately revise your poster according to feedback.

If you are unsure what revisions are appropriate, communicate with the course staff well before the due date.

During the final poster session, your team will give a one minute pitch to a small group of judges. 
Rehearse a pitch that summarizes the problem and your design.
This pitch should convince an audience that your problem was worth investigating and that your design suggests a compelling direction.

### 4p: Poster Session

<app-assignment-due-text dueText="{{ page.due_project_4p }}"></app-assignment-due-text>

Come to the poster session to show off your work and engage with your classmates. 
Present your pitch to a team of judges, 
and take the opportunity to discuss your work with classmates and visitors while reflecting on a busy and productive quarter.

#### Grading

The poster session will be graded as part of participation. We intentionally will not conduct any evaluation at the poster session itself. 

<div class="alert alert-danger" markdown="1">

1. Create a project website that provides an overview of the project, 
   presents your design process, and introduces team members. 
   At a minimum, it must include links to
   your [Assignment 2](/assignments/assignment2/) report, 
   your [Assignment 3](/assignments/assignment3/) report, your video prototype, and your poster.
   Optionally, also include your presentations or other materials.
   Ideally, much of this same content will also be presented in a manner more appropriate for the web. 
   
   Be sure you have updated any documents that course staff said needed fixed before posting 
   (e.g., any report that accidentally included participant identifying information). 

### 4a: Initial Website

<app-assignment-due-text dueText="{{ page.due_project_4a }}"></app-assignment-due-text>

The goal of this milestone is to post an initial project website as part of the course website.

We will use your websites to advertise the poster session.
Although this is an initial website on which you will get feedback and will be able to update,
you should submit a complete and high-quality version of your website appropriate for advertising the course projects.

Your website will be served from a subdirectory of this course website.

Within the GitHub repository of the course:

<p>[https://github.com/uwcse440/web-cse440-wi19](https://github.com/uwcse440/web-cse440-wi19)</p>

You will submit your website as a set of static files in your project directory:

`angular-workspace/src/assets/projects/**projectpath**`
 
It is also linked via a thumb from the projects page:

<p>[Projects Page](/projects.html)</p>

You should provide an appropriate 150x150 thumb at:

`angular-workspace/src/assets/projects/**projectpath**/project_thumb.png`

You can build your website however you like, but everything needed for your site must be in your directory.
Do not attempt to integrate with the functionality used for this course website.
Simply build your website and submit the set of static files to be served from your directory. 
Because you must provide a set of static files for your website, you may not use external site builders (e.g., Wix).

Because your website will be served from a directory, be sure to use relative paths within your source.

You will later add your video to the website. You may want to plan ahead for that additional content.

<!-- Samples from Prior Offerings -->
<app-assignment-samples sampleToLink="website"></app-assignment-samples>

#### Submission

Submit a pull request containing your website. We will merge as quickly as possible. 
You can submit multiple requests as needed to fix issues or improve your website.
Your request should not modify anything outside your project website.

Submit simple pull requests early so that you become familiar with this functionality.
Do not wait until the final moments to begin to learn how to do this.

If you are absolutely unable to submit a pull request, submit via Canvas here:

<app-assignment-submission-link linkSubmission="{{ page.link_project_4a }}"></app-assignment-submission-link>

#### Contribution Statement

<app-assignment-contribution-statement></app-assignment-contribution-statement>

#### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __8 points__:

1.  __Completeness of Content__: (3 points)
2.  __Appropriately Clear and Polished Presentation__: (3 points)
3.  __Submitted via Pull Request__: (2 points)

Your website should be complete and will be evaluated as such.
But later critique and refinement will help further improve it before the final poster session.
