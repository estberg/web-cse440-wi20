<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Even for a well-understood, well-motivated problem, choosing a design to invest time into is a difficult and laborious process.
This group assignment, spanning multiple weeks of the course, tackles the problem of selecting the right design through
<strong>design research</strong>, <strong>task development</strong>, <strong>generating multiple potential designs</strong>, and finally <strong>selecting a design</strong> to pursue.</p>

<h2 id="project-description">Project Description</h2>
<p>In this assignment, you will brainstorm a large set of possible tasks and design ideas for your project.
You will then conduct design research to learn more about your problem and the current practices of people who might use your design.
You will draw upon the ideas developed in your brainstorming and the observations made in your design research
to help develop a set of potential tasks your design might support.
You will next sketch how a set of initial designs might support those tasks.
You will choose a design to pursue in the remainder of the course and storyboard the details of your design in the context of important tasks.
Finally, you will present your design process in a report and presentation.</p>
<p>More specifically, you will do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Generate ideas for potential problems, tasks, features, and interactions using a group ideation exercise.</p>
<p>(<app-generated-link linkHREF="#id-2a-project-ideation">Assignment 2a</app-generated-link>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conduct design research (e.g., contextual inquiry, interviews, observations) to learn from at least <strong>three</strong> people who might use your design.</p>
<p>(<app-generated-link linkHREF="#id-2b-design-research-plan">Assignment 2b</app-generated-link>), (<app-generated-link linkHREF="#id-2c-design-research-check-in">Assignment 2c</app-generated-link>), (<app-generated-link linkHREF="#id-2d-design-research-review">Assignment 2d</app-generated-link>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop <strong>six</strong> tasks that might be performed with your design.</p>
<p>Select these to capture the important aspects of the problem you are solving and to provide coverage of the designs
you will explore. Create these based on your observations and analyses of existing tasks as well as your vision for
new tasks enabled by potential designs. Remember that tasks say what is accomplished, while leaving open how to accomplish it.</p>
<p>As you progress through your project, you can and should consider revising your tasks.
Expect to refine or change your tasks as your understanding of the problem matures or according to feedback you receive.
The tasks you report in this assignment therefore must be appropriate but are not necessarily final.</p>
<p>(<app-generated-link linkHREF="#id-2e-task-review">Assignment 2e</app-generated-link>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brainstorm and sketch <strong>three</strong> very different initial designs for your interface.
Each design should support <strong>four</strong> of your tasks.</p>
<p>Do not illustrate the entire design, but instead sketch key aspects needed to illustrate the functionality.
These should be rough sketches on paper (i.e., not digital mockups), including illustrations of their relations
(e.g., arrows showing transitions and relationships).</p>
<p>The purpose of these sketches is to explore the design space before you lock yourself into a single design.
They must demonstrate significant consideration of substantially different approaches to your problem.</p>
<p>(<app-generated-link linkHREF="#id-2f-design-check-in-3x4">Assignment 2f</app-generated-link>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From your sketches, select <strong>one</strong> design to pursue for the remainder of the quarter and <strong>two</strong> tasks that emphasize
critical functionality of your design. These tasks should be non-trivial, critical to solving your problem, and should
emphasize long-lived or repeated activities. In contrast, a one-time login screen for a social networking application
is not worth being the focus of your project, does not define your project functionality, and is not sufficiently interesting.</p>
<p>Storyboard your chosen design for your chosen tasks, illustrating how the tasks are accomplished in your design.</p>
<p>(<app-generated-link linkHREF="#id-2g-design-review-1x2">Assignment 2g</app-generated-link>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Summarize your design process in a report and presentation.</p>
<p>(<app-generated-link linkHREF="#id-2h-final-report">Assignment 2h</app-generated-link>), (<app-generated-link linkHREF="#id-2i-presentation">Assignment 2i</app-generated-link>)</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
<h3 id="id-2a-project-ideation">2a: Project Ideation</h3>
<p><app-assignment-due-text dueText="{{ page.due_project_2a }}"></app-assignment-due-text></p>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to begin thinking about how to plan effective design research to inform your design process.</p>
<p>Generate 5 to 10 different ideas related to each of the following aspects of your project proposal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forms: types of technology on which a design might be developed (e.g., wearable sensors, watch/phone/tablet, desktop, appliances or other artifacts in the environment).</li>
<li>Data: types of data a design might track or help a person track.</li>
<li>Tasks: what a person might accomplish with a design.</li>
<li>Features: a specific capability a design might have.</li>
<li>Social Interactions: types of social interactions and situations a design might engage or support.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will provide large sheets of paper. Divide a large sheet of paper into 32 squares, each approximately 2in by 2in.
Sketch your ideas, one in each square. Each idea should be either a quick doodle with a caption or a one-sentence idea.
A person familiar with your project but not in your group should be able to understand the idea each sketch conveys.</p>
<p>The goal is to begin exploring the space of possibilities, not attempting to polish some individual possibility.
Focus on the quantity of ideas, not the quality of any one idea.
You may include ideas from existing products. No two ideas should be alike.
When you get stuck, find a context to inspire new ideas.</p>
<p>Given a space of possible directions, your project needs to begin to gather information on how to generate and consider ideas.
Following up on the above, additionally brainstorm:</p>
<ul>
<li>People: types of people you might work with to learn more.</li>
<li>Focus: on what parts of the problem you might focus your learning.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="submission">Submission</h4>
<p>At the end of section, capture and submit an image of your brainstorm.</p>
<p>Submit via Canvas here:</p>
<p><app-assignment-submission-link linkSubmission="{{ page.link_project_2a }}"></app-assignment-submission-link></p>
<p>You will be able to take your paper with you, and you should continue brainstorming throughout your project.</p>
<h4 id="contribution-statement">Contribution Statement</h4>
<p>This submission does not require a team contribution statement.</p>
<h4 id="grading">Grading</h4>
<p>This milestone will be graded on a scale of <strong>3 points</strong> based on participation in generating ideas during the brainstorming exercise.</p>
<h3 id="id-2b-design-research-plan">2b: Design Research Plan</h3>
<p><app-assignment-due-text dueText="{{ page.due_project_2b }}"></app-assignment-due-text></p>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to develop an initial plan for your design research.</p>
<p>In one paragraph, describe the people who might use your design and other stakeholders to consider in your design.
Among potential stakeholders, describe the <strong>participants</strong> you plan to pursue, including such details as their background and the environment where you will examine their current practices. Give enough information to convince us that you can actually find and engage with your target participants in the next week.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, your target participants should not be &quot;doctors&quot; but instead a specific group of doctors
(e.g., Family Practitioners in the UW Roosevelt Clinic).
If gaining access to the target participants is non-trivial (e.g., as with busy doctors),
describe the steps you have already taken to gain access and your plans to recover if you are unable to gain access.
Indicate when you will be conducting your design research, being as specific as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>In another paragraph, describe the <strong>specific design research methods</strong> you will use to engage with and learn from these people. The most common method used is contextual inquiry with three participants. However,  we encourage you to propose alternative or additional design research methods according to your needs. Please be as specific as possible, providing relevant details for you proposed methods. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you propose contextual inquiries, discuss current behaviors you want to observe and your planned focus.</li>
<li>If you propose interviews, discuss the types of questions you plan to explore.</li>
<li>If you propose a diary study, discuss what type of data you plan to ask participants to bring or collect.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a second page, provide more detail regarding your primary proposed method. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you propose contextual inquiries, enumerate what activities you intend to observe,
what focus you intend to bring to observation of each activity,
how you will approach the development of partnership,
and any other strategies you intend to pursue for gaining insight through your observations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you propose interviews, give an example set of talking points, such as these
(note these are all longer than a page, but intended to illustrate a thorough script):</p>
<ul>
<li>

<li>
<p>If you propose a diary study, give details of what and how you will ask participants to diary.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="samples-from-prior-offerings">Samples from Prior Offerings</h4>
<div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
<p>The request for a second page of more detail regarding the proposed primary method was new in the Autumn 2017 offering. It does not appear in prior samples.</p>
<p>The goal in soliciting this additional detail is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage you to work through more of the details.</li>
<li>Help improve those details through critique and peer feedback prior to your initial design research.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Samples from prior offerings include:</p>

<p><app-assignment-due-text dueText="{{ page.due_project_2c }}"></app-assignment-due-text></p>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to begin your design research,
reflect on what you observe and learn,
then update your plans for additional design research.</p>
<p>Complete design research with at least one participant prior to this check-in.
You hopefully learned something about the needs of people who might use your design,
but also about effectively conducting your design research.</p>
<p>Describe your first design research participant and your findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who you observed or interviewed, their background, and the environment.</li>
<li>What did you learn?</li>
<li>What tasks, problems, or opportunities did you uncover?</li>
<li>Did you encounter any difficulties establishing rapport or getting the information you need?</li>
</ul>
<p>Discuss what remains to be pursued in your additional design research.
We fully expect changes will be necessary, as design research
can be difficult to get right and often important topics are left unresolved.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are your plans for the remaining participants?</li>
<li>How do you plan to change your design research plan based on what you learned with your first participant?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="id-2d-design-research-review">2d: Design Research Review</h3>
<p><app-assignment-due-text dueText="{{ page.due_project_2d }}"></app-assignment-due-text></p>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to reflect on what you observed and learned in your design research,
organizing observations around themes to tasks to help inform your design.</p>
<h4 id="themes">Themes</h4>
<p>Complete design research with a total of at least three participants. Discuss your process and what you learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who you observed or interviewed, their background, and the environment.</li>
<li>Note anything unique about each participant and comment on the rationale behind these observations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Across your participants, we expect some emergence of common themes, problems, and practices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify high-level themes and problems the participants share in their practices.</li>
<li>Do these themes, problems, and practices suggest tasks that are important to design for?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are having trouble identifying high-level themes, problems, and practices,
it may indicate a need to develop additional understanding through more design research.
Because your findings at this point are critical to setting a foundation for your project,
ensure your design research has provided you the insights and perspective you need to proceed.</p>
<h4 id="task-analysis-questions">Task Analysis Questions</h4>
<p>Informed by your design research, provide brief answers to the following questions.
These should help you begin to identify tasks essential to your design.</p>
<ol>
<li>Who is going to use the design?</li>
<li>What tasks do they now perform?</li>
<li>What tasks are desired?</li>
<li>How are the tasks learned?</li>
<li>Where are the tasks performed?</li>
<li>What is the relationship between the person and data?</li>
<li>What other tools does the person have?</li>
<li>How do people communicate with each other?</li>
<li>How often are the tasks performed?</li>
<li>What are the time constraints on the tasks?</li>
<li>What happens when things go wrong?</li>

<p><app-assignment-due-text dueText="{{ page.due_project_2e }}"></app-assignment-due-text></p>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to develop a set of tasks that you will explore in a set of potential designs.</p>
<p>Building on what you learned in your design research, design <strong>six tasks</strong> that you believe are integral to your overall design goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>You should include existing tasks (i.e., tasks people already do) and new tasks (i.e., tasks that will be enabled by your design).</li>
<li>These should be real world tasks that have details (e.g., instead of &quot;programming a DVR&quot;, details like &quot;programming a DVR to record the Simpsons on Sundays&quot;).</li>
<li>These tasks should not have any specific relation to the exact design sketches you will brainstorm next.</li>
<li>Your six tasks should span a wide range of functionality and difficulty, from easy to hard tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each task should be described in text. Tasks say what is accomplished, leaving open how to accomplish it.
Be sure that your task conveys a problem and what is accomplished, rather than a step-by-step walkthrough of scenario with a specific design.</p>

<p><app-assignment-due-text dueText="{{ page.due_project_2f }}"></app-assignment-due-text></p>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to develop distinct design ideas that address your tasks.</p>
<p>You have identified and described six important tasks for your design problem.
You will now brainstorm and sketch three very different <strong>initial designs</strong> for your interface:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each design should support four of your tasks, but they do not necessarily need to all support the same four tasks.</li>
<li>Sketch key aspects needed to illustrate the functionality in your four tasks. A design may imply additional tasks, but do not illustrate the entire design.</li>
<li>These should be rough sketches on paper (i.e., not digital mockups), including illustrations of their relations (e.g., arrows showing transitions and relationships).</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of these sketches is to explore the design space before you lock yourself into a single design.
They must demonstrate significant consideration of substantially different approaches to your problem.</p>

<h3 id="id-2g-design-review-1x2">2g: Design Review (&quot;1x2&quot;)</h3>
<p><app-assignment-due-text dueText="{{ page.due_project_2g }}"></app-assignment-due-text></p>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to choose a design idea to pursue in the remainder of this course.</p>
<p>From your design sketches, select one design that you will refine in the remainder of this course.
Then select two tasks that will be the focus of your design refinement.
The selected tasks need to be representative of the experience of using your design.</p>
<p>Prepare one paragraph describing <em>why you selected the design</em> you did.
Draw upon feedback from critiques and data from your design research.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why this design and these tasks?</li>
<li>What makes the design better suited to the people for whom you are targeting your design?</li>
<li>Why are these tasks more compelling than the others?</li>
</ul>
<p>Convey a strong understanding of which design you chose, which tasks you chose, and why you chose them.</p>
<p>Then <em>create a storyboard of each task</em> for your selected design.
These should be done on paper, then scanned (i.e., do not create or recreate them in a drawing package).
They should clearly indicate the functionality of the design and what the interface will be like,
conveying the major aspects of the design in enough detail that a person not in your group can understand
how the design supports each task.
As needed, add descriptions that explicitly reference the storyboard, add more sketches, or annotate them in multiple colors.</p>
<h4 id="samples-from-prior-offerings-6">Samples from Prior Offerings</h4>
<p>Samples from prior offerings include:</p>
<p><app-assignment-samples sampleToLink="2g"></app-assignment-samples></p>
<p>Note that details of assignments may have changed since prior offerings, so their reports may not map to the current project.
Also note these samples are intended to illustrate a variety of approaches, none of which is intended to be ideal or exemplary.
Be sure to understand and carefully consider project requirements and feedback from the course staff in the context of your own work.</p>
<h4 id="submission-7">Submission</h4>
<p>No more than one page of text in PDF format:</p>
<ul>
<li>discussion of your design and task choices (one paragraph)</li>
<li>scanned images of your storyboards and associated descriptions</li>
</ul>
<p>Images do not count against your page limit, and are therefore effectively free.
You should embed images throughout your PDF, keeping them near the text that references them.
The limit applies to the approximate amount of text you would have if all images were removed.</p>
<p>Submit via Canvas here:</p>
<p><app-assignment-submission-link linkSubmission="{{ page.link_project_2g }}"></app-assignment-submission-link></p>
<p>Be prepared to discuss your choices and storyboards with other teams and the course staff.</p>

<h3 id="id-2h-final-report">2h: Final Report</h3>
<p><app-assignment-due-text dueText="{{ page.due_project_2h }}"></app-assignment-due-text></p>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to communicate the design research that motivates your design.</p>
<p>Prepare a report documenting your process of getting the right design.
Your report should follow the outline below, and will be graded using the guidelines that follow.
The provided page allocations are estimates, intended to help convey how to divide up the space.</p>
<p>If you completed all of your milestones above, you will have much of the content for this report.
But it is critical that you revise and update that content.
You have received extensive feedback throughout your design process, and evaluation of your report will
include how you have addressed and incorporated that feedback to improve relative to your prior milestones.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Title</strong></p>
<p>A short, creative, and marketable title capturing the key idea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Each Team Member’s Name</strong></p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Design Research Goals, Stakeholders, and Participants</strong>: (1 page)</p>
<p>Describe your design research, including the participants, their background, and their environment.</p>
<p>Describe why you chose the specific methods and participants in your design research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Design Research Results and Themes</strong>: (1 page)</p>
<p>Discuss common themes, problems, and practices that emerged in your design research.</p>
<p>Include any updated themes that emerged when considering your design research in your design process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Answers to Task Analysis Questions</strong>: (2 pages)</p>
<p>Provide brief answers to the task analysis questions.</p>

<p>Convert your two tasks into written scenarios for your design.
Scenarios include the steps a person will go through to accomplish the task, including references to your design.</p>
<p>Scenarios do not need to detail every little step, but should be realistic, should be dependent upon the design
you have chosen, should appropriately reference elements of your design, and should communicate how a person
will accomplish the task using your design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Storyboards of the Selected Design</strong></p>
<p>Include updated storyboards of your design. Reference these appropriately in your scenarios.</p>
