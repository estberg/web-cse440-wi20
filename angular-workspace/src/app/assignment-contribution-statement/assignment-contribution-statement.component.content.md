Your submission must also include a team contribution statement, as an additional page in your submission.

This statement should indicate the name of each member of your team, 
the percentage of effort in this specific assignment that each member contributed,
and the specific activities in this specific assignment that each member contributed. 

An example contribution statement is:

- *Name 1*: 40%, researched the background of the problem, outlined the content of the document, wrote the first version of one paragraph, selected the images to be included
- *Name 2*: 15%, conducted 3 interviews and took notes
- *Name 3*: 20%, wrote the first version of the background section, made sure the final document was submitted
- *Name 4*: 25%, organized the group meeting, conducted 3 interviews (with Name 2), put together the first draft of the document's results section

This contribution statement is intended to support your own reflection as a team as well as the staff's awareness of your efforts.
You should therefore discuss and agree upon this statement of what each of you contributed and how much this contributed to the overall assignment. 
The staff does not expect each person to contribute equally to each assignment, but you should work as a team to support each other, and we expect all members will contribute over the quarter.
The staff also understands that percentages are incomplete and subjective, so we gather them only as a summary indication and will not use them directly in any grade calculation.
